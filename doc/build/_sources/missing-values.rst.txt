Missing Values
===============

We'll now take a look at the missing values ​​in each column and let's treat these empty fields. There are two most used approaches to dealing with missing values:

* Fill in these values ​​arbitrarily (average, median, most frequent value);

* Delete the entire line.

In order not to throw out information from an entire line just because of a missing field, we can fill the field.

For the age and rate variables, we placed the median value; and for the port of shipment variable, we put the value more frequently.
